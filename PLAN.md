# Plan

1. Locate the context window gauge and metrics reporter implementations and trace their data sources, update paths, and UI bindings.
2. Review calculation logic end-to-end (token usage, aggregation, costs, reset behavior, gauge normalization, and edge cases).
3. Cross-check formulas and units against configured model limits/pricing and flag discrepancies or ambiguities.
4. Apply minimal fixes if needed and document verification status if no changes are required.
