    <h1>Weekly Progress Report</h1>
    <h2>Michael Martello | January 19-22, 2026</h2>

    <h2>Monday, January 19</h2>
    <p>Focused on Orchestrator performance and UX improvements. Optimized the Focus/Shadow method to reduce latency, then added a new Knowledge Base 3D canvas with a snake-pattern layout for better visualization of loaded agents.</p>
    <p>Fixed a critical bug where Direct Chat returned 400 errors when too many agents were loaded. Improved overall UX by collapsing advanced settings by default and defaulting to RLM Hybrid mode.</p>
    <p>Made sub-queries dynamic based on agent count (up to 25 agents max) and added a toggle to disable model mixing. Introduced the "Go Deeper" feature for progressive sub-query depth. Also fixed CSV export issues and added RLM sub-method indicators.</p>
    <p class="value-add">Value Add: More stable multi-agent queries, better visualization, and user-controlled query depth.</p>

    <h2>Tuesday, January 20</h2>
    <p>Shifted focus to testing and validation. Added memory retention test results and created a 50-question memory test with import/export capabilities for the test builder.</p>
    <p>Fixed a duplicate function bug causing button issues. Improved KB canvas grouping visuals and layout, switching to horizontal arrangement with 2-column grids.</p>
    <p>Created a detailed implementation plan for "Societies of Thought" enhancements and added group filtering support to the RLM pipeline. Also added the "Make Agenda" feature to Agent Builder.</p>
    <p class="value-add">Value Add: Established testing infrastructure, better group organization, and new agenda generation capability.</p>

    <h2>Wednesday, January 21</h2>
    <p>Dedicated to RLM validation and documentation. Built a comprehensive memory degradation test suite with 25, 50, and 100-question tests to measure how well the system retains context over extended conversations.</p>
    <p>Produced multiple versions of an RLM validation white paper, culminating in a peer-reviewed final report. Cleaned up test results and archived previous report versions.</p>
    <p class="value-add">Value Add: Documented proof of RLM effectiveness with rigorous testing methodology.</p>

    <h2>Thursday, January 22</h2>
    <p>Implemented two major features for Agent Builder:</p>
    <p><strong>1. RLM Integration</strong> - Added a Direct/RLM toggle to the chat interface, allowing users to choose between fast direct queries and deeper RLM-powered analysis. Defaulted to Direct mode with a warning that RLM is better suited for multi-agent scenarios.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Voice Conversation</strong> - Added full voice chat capability with two modes: Push-to-Talk (hold mic, speak, get transcription via Whisper, response via TTS) and Real-time (continuous WebSocket streaming with OpenAI's Realtime API).</p>
    <p>Also added infographic style presets (Executive, Dashboard, Action Board, Timeline) with a consistent black/gold theme. Fixed several Realtime API issues including session configuration, audio format parameters, and error logging.</p>
    <p class="value-add">Value Add: Agent Builder now supports voice interaction and flexible chat modes, making it more accessible and powerful for single-meeting analysis.</p>
