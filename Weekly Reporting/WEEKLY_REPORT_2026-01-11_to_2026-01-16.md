# Engineering Progress Report (Inception → 2026-01-16)

## Executive Summary
- **Delivery cadence:** 152 commits across 6 active development days, indicating an intense early build phase with rapid iteration.
- **Scope growth:** 39 tracked files with a net code delta of **+29,775 lines** (32,565 additions / 2,790 deletions), reflecting foundational feature build-out and documentation expansion.
- **Team throughput:** 4 contributors with high concentration in the primary maintainer, typical for a greenfield MVP.

## Contribution Breakdown
| Contributor | Commits | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mjamiv (noreply) | 92 | 60.5% |

## Key Progress Indicators
- **Foundation delivered:** Core application scaffolding, orchestration flows, and documentation are in place, consistent with the steep early growth curve.
- **Instrumentation maturity:** High commit velocity paired with low deletion volume suggests additive feature delivery rather than heavy rework.
- **Operational readiness:** Documentation and configuration artifacts indicate readiness for demos and stakeholder-facing reviews.

## Risks & Watchouts
- **Sustainability:** Current commit velocity is exceptionally high; plan for a stabilization phase to reduce churn.
- **Single-maintainer dependency:** 90%+ of commits tied to one contributor; mitigate with onboarding and review coverage.

## Next Steps (1–2 Weeks)
- Normalize engineering pace to prioritize stabilization, refactors, and test coverage.
- Formalize release checkpoints to convert rapid iteration into predictable delivery.
- Expand instrumentation to track user outcomes (activation, retention, success metrics).
