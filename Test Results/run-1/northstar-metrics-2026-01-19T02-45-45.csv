1. Persistent or stalled disinflation / inflation remaining above 2%
- Disinflation had slowed or stalled; core inflation remained somewhat elevated, limiting scope for easing (Apr–May 2024; Nov 2024; Jan 2025; Jul 2025).
- Upside inflation risks from policy changes (trade, immigration) were noted (Jan 2025; Jul 2025).

2. Lags in monetary policy transmission
- Long and uncertain policy lags made additional firming less certain and complicated timing (May 2023; noted elsewhere).

3. Tightening financial and credit conditions
- Higher longer-term yields and mortgage rates, tighter credit conditions, and related transmission effects constrained policy moves (May 2023; Apr–May 2024; Oct 2023; Jan 2025).

4. Financial‑market strains and stability risks
- Quarter‑end money‑market pressures, pronounced repo spikes, and the first substantive use of the Standing Repo Facility flagged risks to market functioning (Nov 2024; Jul 2025).
- Elevated downside risks to employment stemming from these strains were also raised by dissenting members (Jul 2025).

5. Broad financial vulnerabilities
- Elevated asset valuations, bank duration exposure, nonbank leverage, and commercial real estate stress were seen as potential impediments to policy or stability (Jan 2025).

6. Labor‑market tightness / downside risks to activity
- A still-tight labor market and employment near maximum reduced confidence that inflation would move sustainably to 2% and limited scope for rapid easing; cumulative policy tightening also posed downside risks to activity (Apr–May 2024; Nov 2024; Oct 2023).

7. External and policy uncertainties
- Trade policy and tariffs (including tariff-driven goods‑price effects), geopolitical developments, and potential fiscal/government shutdown issues were cited as important sources of uncertainty and risk to the outlook (Jul 2025; Oct–Nov 2023).

8. Market pricing and communications effects
- Shifts in market pricing toward a higher expected policy path and communications effects complicating the outlook and the sequencing of easing (Nov 2024).

These items were repeatedly cited across meetings as the main constraints on moving policy more quickly toward easing or on further firming.

1. Inflation and inflation‑tracking risks
- Persistent/slowed disinflation: core inflation remaining above the 2% goal.  
- Upside inflation risks from policy and external shocks (trade/tariffs, immigration‑related effects, other policy changes).

2. Financial‑market functioning and market strains
- Quarter‑end money‑market pressures and pronounced repo‑market spikes.  
- Use and efficacy concerns about the Standing Repo Facility (SRF).  
- Broader financial‑market strains and stability risks (tightening liquidity, stressed funding markets).

3. Reserves, operations, and debt‑limit risks
- Reserve volatility related to the debt limit and associated operational risks for Desk/SOMA operations and balance‑sheet runoff.

4. Financial‑sector vulnerabilities and tighter financial conditions
- Elevated asset valuations, banks’ duration exposure, nonbank leverage, commercial‑real‑estate stress.  
- Tighter financial conditions: higher longer‑term yields and mortgage rates, mixed risk‑asset/credit signals.

5. Risks to activity and labor market
- Downside risks to economic activity and employment from cumulative policy tightening and from financial‑market strains.  
- A still‑tight labor market with uncertainty about wage/employment dynamics.

6. Geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty
- Trade policy, tariffs, geopolitical developments, and possible fiscal/government disruptions (including potential shutdowns).

These themes were the recurring risks across the meetings in the materials you shared.

- **Elevated asset valuations and risk of sharp repricing**
  - Valuations seen as stretched, increasing vulnerability to a sudden correction (FOMC‑202507; Agent 7‑fomc‑202510; FOMC‑202505; Agent 6‑FOMC‑202509).

- **Treasury market functioning: weaker depth/intermediation and leverage-linked fragilities**
  - Concerns about **deterioration in Treasury market depth and intermediation capacity** (FOMC‑202507).
  - **High leverage/exposures tied to Treasuries**, including hedge funds’ large Treasury positions (Agent 7‑fomc‑202510) and “high hedge‑fund leverage” more broadly (FOMC‑202505).

- **Short‑term funding / money‑market fragility (repo pressures, SRF usage, ON RRP decline)**
  - **Quarter‑end repo spikes** and **unusually high SRF usage** (e.g., ~$11B on June 30) (FOMC‑202507).
  - **Repo rates rising vs. IORB**, **SRF usage increasing**, and **ON RRP falling**, interpreted as a sign reserves could be nearing “ample” and that money markets were more fragile (Agent 7‑fomc‑202510).
  - Similar themes: upward pressure on repo and quarter‑end strains; SRF use as a backstop (Agent 6‑FOMC‑202509).

- **Reserves and liquidity trajectory risks (runoff, TGA rebuild, ON RRP dynamics, debt‑limit distortions)**
  - Declining reserves over time due to **SOMA runoff + TGA rebuild + falling ON RRP**, potentially worsening episodic liquidity pressures (FOMC‑202507; Agent 6‑FOMC‑202509).
  - **Debt‑limit dynamics** distorting reserve signals and raising the risk reserves could drop quickly when the TGA is rebuilt (FOMC‑202503).

- **Credit risk and “hidden leverage,” especially outside banks**
  - **Nonbank vulnerabilities**: leverage and rollover risks (FOMC‑202507).
  - **Worsening credit quality** (rising bankruptcies, some bank credit losses) and concerns about **private‑credit quality** and “hidden” leverage (Agent 7‑fomc‑202510).
  - **Corporate credit spreads**: slight widening but still low on average (Agent 7‑fomc‑202510); widening noted after tariffs (FOMC‑202505) and amid broader volatility/tightening (FOMC‑202503).

- **Tariff/trade-policy shocks raising volatility and complicating pricing**
  - Tariff announcements associated with **large cross‑asset volatility** (Treasury yields up, spreads wider, equities swinging) and **reduced liquidity** (FOMC‑202505).
  - Trade‑policy uncertainty raising **near‑term inflation compensation** and increasing downside growth risk priced by markets (FOMC‑202503).
  - Related note: **rising short‑horizon inflation compensation** partly tariff‑driven, adding volatility/uncertainty (FOMC‑202507).

- **Market pricing anomalies / uncertainty about the policy path**
  - **Unusual correlations** (e.g., rising long yields alongside a weaker dollar) raising questions about safe‑haven flows and market dynamics (FOMC‑202505).
  - Elevated tail risk/uncertainty about the future funds‑rate path (FOMC‑202503).
  - Repricing toward near‑term easing affecting financial conditions and exposures (Agent 6‑FOMC‑202509).

- **Emerging payments/stablecoin risks**
  - Risks from **payment stablecoins** and the **composition/quality of backing assets** (FOMC‑202507).  
  - *Discrepancy note:* this stablecoin concern appears in FOMC‑202507, but it is **not mentioned** in the other 2025 sources you provided.

- **One point of disagreement on conditions (orderly vs. strained money markets)**
  - FOMC‑202505 notes **money markets were orderly and reserves abundant** (while also noting ON RRP usage had increased).
  - Other 2025 sources emphasize **tightening/volatility** in funding markets, repo spikes, and meaningful SRF usage (FOMC‑202507; Agent 7‑fomc‑202510; Agent 6‑FOMC‑202509; FOMC‑202503).
