1. Inflation and disinflation risks
- Inflation still above the 2% goal; core inflation remaining elevated and disinflation progress stalled.
- Upside inflation risks (including tariff-driven goods‑price effects).

2. Economic and labor‑market resilience
- Stronger‑than‑expected economic activity and a tight labor market, reducing scope for policy easing.
- Rising downside risks to employment noted by some participants.

3. Policy transmission and uncertainty
- Policy lags that make the effects of further tightening (or easing) uncertain.
- Market pricing shifting toward a higher expected policy‑rate path (fewer/later cuts), complicating communication and outlook.

4. Credit conditions and potential tightening
- Concerns that credit tightening or tighter lending conditions could constrain activity and amplify policy effects.

5. Financial conditions and market developments
- Tighter overall financial conditions: higher longer‑term yields and mortgage rates, higher real yields and term premium, lower equity prices, and a stronger dollar.
- Quarter‑end money‑market pressures and short‑term funding stress (pronounced repo spikes, first non‑test use of the Standing Repo Facility).

6. Financial‑stability risks and banking sector vulnerabilities
- Elevated asset valuations, bank duration exposure, nonbank leverage, commercial real estate risks, and other financial‑stability concerns.

7. External and policy uncertainty
- Elevated uncertainty around trade/tariff developments and their effects on goods prices.
- Geopolitical developments and potential fiscal/government shutdown issues.

### Items sometimes mistaken as Q4 but actually outside Q4 (for clarity)
- **Jan 28–29, 2025 meeting action items** are listed in **[FOMC-202501]** (e.g., Desk SOMA operations; SRF efficacy improvements; framework review), but **this is Q1 2025, not Q4 2024**.

- Inflation / disinflation risks
  - Inflation persistence; slow or stalled disinflation and the commitment to return inflation to 2%.
  - Upside inflation risks (notably tariff‑ or trade‑driven goods‑price effects; possible trade/immigration policy changes).

- Labor‑market risks
  - Rising downside risks to employment even as labor‑market strength persists or eases unevenly.

- Financial‑stability and banking‑sector risks
  - Banking‑sector vulnerabilities (including bank duration exposure).
  - Elevated asset valuations, nonbank leverage, and commercial‑real‑estate stresses.

- Market/financial‑conditions risks
  - Tightening financial conditions (higher long‑term yields, mortgage rates, shifts in credit spreads and risk‑asset behavior).
  - Short‑term funding strains and market‑functioning issues (e.g., quarter‑end repo spikes, use of the Standing Repo Facility).

- Uncertainty / policy‑transmission risks
  - Elevated uncertainty about the outlook and how policy transmits (amplifying the above risks).

- Overall assessment
  - Participants generally judged risks to the dual mandate (inflation vs. employment) to be roughly balanced.

  - Elevated volatility after tariff announcements: longer-term Treasury yields rose, credit spreads widened, equities swung sharply; near-term inflation compensation increased (tariff pass-through risk), raising *downside growth* and *upside inflation* risks. *(Source: [FOMC-202505])*
  - Trade/tariff uncertainty lifted near-term inflation compensation and tail risks, contributing to wider spreads and weaker risk sentiment. *(Source: [FOMC-202503])*

- **Liquidity and market-functioning concerns (especially in Treasuries)**
  - Deterioration in market liquidity after tariff news, though markets continued to function. *(Source: [FOMC-202505])*
  - Treasury-market fragility: concerns about market depth and the role/capacity of intermediaries. *(Source: [FOMC-202507])*

- **Unusual cross-asset correlations and safe-haven questions**
  - Rising long-term yields alongside a weaker dollar (an atypical pattern) raised questions about safe-haven flows and underlying market dynamics. *(Source: [FOMC-202505])*
  - **Discrepancy to note:** In March, the dollar was described as *depreciating* alongside widening spreads and weaker equities, consistent with [FOMC-202505]’s “weaker dollar” theme; other provided sources don’t explicitly confirm the same correlation pattern, so the “unusual correlations” point is specific to May’s discussion. *(Sources: [FOMC-202503], [FOMC-202505])*

- **Elevated valuations and compressed risk premia increasing vulnerability to shocks**
  - Elevated/rich equity valuations and (at points) compressed credit spreads were seen as financial-stability vulnerabilities. *(Sources: [FOMC-202507], [Agent 6-FOMC-202509])*
  - Concentration of equity gains in large tech firms raised valuation concerns. *(Source: [Agent 7-fomc-202510])*
  - **Discrepancy to note:** Some meetings emphasized *widening* credit spreads (risk-off) while others emphasized *tight/compressed* spreads (risk-on vulnerability). This likely reflects changing conditions over 2025 rather than a direct conflict. *(Sources: [FOMC-202505], [FOMC-202503] vs. [FOMC-202507], [Agent 6-FOMC-202509])*

- **Leverage and nonbank financial intermediation risks (hedge funds/private credit)**

  - Concerns about “hidden”/opaque leverage and underwriting/credit quality in nonbank and private credit. *(Source: [Agent 7-fomc-202510])*
  - Rollover/refinancing risks in nonbank intermediaries. *(Source: [FOMC-202507])*

- **Risky credit deterioration / credit-quality concerns**
  - Corporate spreads widened in risk-off episodes; increased scrutiny of risky and private-credit quality, with mentions of bankruptcies and some bank credit losses. *(Sources: [FOMC-202503], [Agent 7-fomc-202510])*

- **Money-market and short-term funding pressures; reserve-adequacy concerns**
  - Signs of tightening/volatility in repo and money markets: repo rates rising vs IORB, ON RRP usage falling, SRF usage increasing; concern that continued balance-sheet runoff plus other flows could intensify volatility and complicate rate control. *(Source: [Agent 7-fomc-202510])*
  - Quarter-end repo spikes and record SRF usage; risks from projected declines in reserves (SOMA runoff, TGA rebuild, ON RRP depletion). *(Source: [FOMC-202507])*
  - Debt-limit/TGA dynamics distorting reserve signals and raising the risk reserves could drop quickly when the TGA is rebuilt. *(Source: [FOMC-202503])*
  - Rising repo rates and money-market pressure tied to Treasury issuance, TGA rebuilding, and runoff; monitoring SRF as a backstop. *(Source: [Agent 6-FOMC-202509])*

- **Market-structure/systemic-risk tradeoffs (clearing/backstops)**
  - Discussion of potential market-structure fixes (e.g., central clearing for SRF transactions): possible benefits for rate control vs. systemic-risk concerns (greater CCP importance; potential to expand nonbank leverage). *(Source: [Agent 7-fomc-202510])*
